For the first week, we will meet briefly at 3:00pm in 611 Carr Hall.

We will go over the organization of the course and make sure everyone is setup
and ready to go for the first lecture next week.

Please do the following before coming to class:

- create an account on GitHub [https://github.com](https://github.com)
- install the latest version of R (3.1.2) from [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
- install the latest version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

If you run into issues, we'll try to solve them in class.

See you tomorrow!
