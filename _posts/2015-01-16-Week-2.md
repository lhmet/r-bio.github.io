We'll be meeting tomorrow at 12:50 at the computer lab (611 Carr Hall).

I'll be giving a lecture that covers the basics of R needed for programming. In
  preparation, I encourage you to read [R for Cats](http://rforcats.net/) (at
  least up to the section "using packages"). While you read it, take note of the
  words you are not familiar with / new words.

  A few days ago, I sent out through github an invitation to join the repository
  for the class. Most of you have accepted it but a few still need to do so. If
  you didn't get an email or lost it, a notification for "joining the team"
  should wait for you on github.

See you tomorrow!
