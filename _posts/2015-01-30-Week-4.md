title: Week 4 -- January 30th, 2015
---

Given that the pitches last week went really well, I think it will be more
productive if I sit down with each of you for a few minutes to make sure you
will be able to get started to work on your own next week.

If you had posted the notes of your pitches on GitHub last week, I provided
comments and indicated what you had to bring for tomorrow's class. If it's not
the case, send me an email before class tomorrow.

For tomorrow, I encourage you to:

- review the [notes from last week](/02-data-frames)
- bring your datasets (or whatever else I requested) in my GitHub comments

For the lecture, we will continue to explore `data.frame` and hopefully have
enough time to get started writing our own functions.

See you tomorrow!
