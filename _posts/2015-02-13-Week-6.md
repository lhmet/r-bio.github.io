title: Week 6 -- February 13th, 2015
---

The notes from last week are available [here](/04-data-frames-3). We'll cover
the section "Statistics across factor levels" this week.

A few people mentioned on their post-it that they are still a little
uncomfortable with the use of the square brackets. I added three challenges at
the top of last week's lesson so that you can practice your square bracket
skills.

I also posted a bigger challenge nicknamed
"[the sea cucumber challenge](/challenges#sea-cucumber)". Don't feel demoralized if you find
it difficult: it is. No matter your level of expertise, when your code works you
feel like you have super powers, when you fiddle around to try to find the
answer you feel like you have no idea of what is going on. This second state is
the manifestation of the learning process.

If you are stuck, don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub and ask for
help. Remember to read again [seeking help](/seeking-help) before posting your
question. If you think you can help someone stuck, please do!

Remember to comment your code so other people will know what you are doing.

See you Friday!
