## Guidelines for the package presentations

1. The presentations should last about 15 minutes.
1. The support for the presentation is flexible. You can use powerpoint or
   keynote, or something else, but I **strongly** suggest you use an
   [R presentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations). If
   you prefer, you can do live coding (like I do during class) without relying
   on a slideshow.
1. The type of presentation is also flexible (lecture style vs. live coding),
   but I would suggest you make it interactive with people following along by
   having to type the commands you are presenting.
1. In addition of your presentation (you can use the same file as for your
   presentation if you choose an R presentation), you need to create an
   Rmarkdown file that should contain:
   - the general purpose of the package;
   - pieces of code that demonstrate how to use it.  In other words, it should
   look like a vignette for a package. Here is an example for the package
   [lubridate](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)
   and this is the
   [source code](https://github.com/hadley/lubridate/blob/master/vignettes/lubridate.Rmd)
   that was used to generate it, you can also click on the "Raw" button to see
   the exact source code.
1. This Rmarkdown file should be posted on GitHub in the
   [package-presentations](https://github.com/r-bio/package-presentations)
   repository. (I recommend you fork the repository, prepare the presentation in
   your own fork, and create a pull request when you would like me to review
   it).
1. Ideally, you should have a draft of your Rmarkdown file on GitHub at least 3
   days before you are scheduled to give the presentation. If you do so, I
   guarantee that I will provide feedback. If you post your notes less than 3
   days before I can't guarantee that I will provide feedback. The easiest way
   to let me know that your Rmarkdown file is ready for review is to create a
   pull request.
   - Note that you don't need to commit the html file to your repository, only
     the `.Rmd` file.
1. If you have any questions, about the presentation, please
   [open an issue](https://github.com/r-bio/package-presentations/issues/new) on GitHub in
   the `package-presentations` repository.
1. Don't worry too much about the formatting of your notes at this stage. Focus
   on content first, and we can work together on fixing potential issues that
   hinders the rendering of your file later.

## Resources

1. The GitHub workflow for forking a repository, commiting and pushing changes
   to it, and creating a pull request is listed at the bottom of
   [this page](http://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/).
1. The [RStudio website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) lists some good
   references on how to write RMarkdown, in particular look under the
   "Authoring" tab after reading through the "Quick tour".
