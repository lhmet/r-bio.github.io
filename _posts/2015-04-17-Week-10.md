title: Final project presentations

Some guidelines for the final project presentations:

- **Time:** about 15 min total. Leave time for some questions.
- **Presentation format:** you can choose to use whatever presentation you think
is best, but I recommend you use RMarkdown.
- **Project format**: in addition to the presentation, you need to create a
  repository that will contain a RMarkdown document that summarizes your
  project. Given the breadth of topics the exact format/content will
  vary. However, your repository should contain at least some functional pieces
  of R code that are documented, if possible a graph generated with R, and some
  narrative about what your project is about. Once your project is ready (*at
  the latest by class time on April 24th*), you will post the link to your
  GitHub repository if the issue with your name in the
  [logistics repository](https://github.com/r-bio/logistics/issues).

If you need help or need feedback before the deadline, let me know.
