This the website for the "R class" (ZOO6927) also known as "Introduction to
Programming for Biologists" taught for the first time in the Spring 2015 by
[Fran√ßois Michonneau](http://francoismichonneau.net)
([@fmic_](https://twitter.com/fmic_) on Twitter) at the University of
Florida. You can contact me at francois.michonneau @ gmail.com.

The lectures are available and released under a Creative Commons 0
license. Their content is inspired/uses parts of
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org),
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) material, and plenty of original.

The code for the lecture is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/r-bio/r-bio.github.io) and I happily accept pull
requests.
