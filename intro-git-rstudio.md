## What is version control?

![A better backup](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif) (from phdcomics.com)

You know that great paper you just wrote, you were done with it, so you called
it "final". And then, you sent it to your advisor for her last comments. So you
renamed it "final\_thisone". A few days passed, and you realized there was a typo
in your figure, and you renamed it "final\_thisone\_really". A couple of weeks
pass, you get comments back from the reviewer, you start changing it and you
renamed your file "final\_submitted". And then... your advisor
think you should rewrite the conclusion and the file become
"final\_submitted\_really".

A year pass, you are mentoring a new undergrad in the lab, and she asks you for
your final document so she can look at your methods... You open your folder, and
mesmerized by the number of final labelled final, you forget which one if the
correct one. Sounds familiar?

Version control is a category of software that keep track of changes to your
files for you. It allows you to:

- keep the entire history of a file and inspect a file throughout its life time
- tag particular version so you can go back to them easily
- facilitates collaborations and makes contributions transparent
- experiment with code and feature without breaking the main project

Version control is designed to manage source code. It works best when tracking
files stored as plain text and not encoded as binary (e.g., Word documents). It
is the "lab notebook" of the digital world. Because of its powerful and useful
features, it is being used for many different project and can be used to track
data sets (small), text (if you haven't written too much of your dissertation,
you should use version control to keep track of it), images, and much more.

## What is Git?

Git is a particular implementation of version control. It's really powerful and
has many features but we will only scratch the surface.


## What is GitHub?

When you start a Git project on your computer, you are going to store the entire
history of the project locally. The storage of your project and its history is
called a **repository**. It is fine. However, the great advantage of using
version control such as Git is to be able to collaborate with other people (and
also to store your repository somewhere else).

GitHub is a commercial website that lets you store your repository publicly for
free (you need to pay if you want to keep them private, you can also get an
educative account with an `.edu` email address that will give you some free
private accounts). There are other website that offer similar services including
BitBucket. Storing your repositories on these website has many advantages. It
offers a friendly interface to many common operations so that you don't have to
remember how to do them at the command line. They also provide other useful
features including an "Issue tracker" and wikis.

## The Git workflow

We have already "committed", "pulled" and "pushed" but we haven't been through
the details of what it means how these pieces fit together.

![The different Git areas]({{site.baseurl}}img/git_areas.png)

The typical workflow goes like this:
- you create/edit/modify a file inside your repository
- you **stage** the changes to the staging area
- you **commit** these changes which creates a permanent snapshot of the file in
  the Git directory along with a message that indicates what you did to the
  file.

When you start a new project, the files in your working directory are
**untracked**, you will first need to **add** them to your repository before Git
can keep track of them and their history.

At this stage, everything is still on your hard drive. To upload your
modifications (i.e., your commits) to GitHub you need to **push** to it.

If you are working with other people you are also committing your shared
repository on GitHub, you will need to **pull** to bring their modifications
into your local copy of the repository.

Commits are cheap. Commit often and provide useful messages so you can keep
track of what you are doing. Don't do this:

## Branching

Branching is a great feature of version control. It allows you to duplicate your
existing repository, develop or experiment with a new feature independently, and
if you like what you are doing you can **merge** these modifications back into
your project.

Branching is particularly important with Git as it is the mechanism that is used
 when you are collaborating to external projects (projects you are not directly
 involved with).

RStudio can't create branches directly, so you need to either:

- create them in GitHub and pull the changes in your repository;
- create them from the Shell (Tools > Shell) and type `git checkout -b
  new-branch`

## Pull requests

With a **pull request** you are asking someone who maintains a repository to
pull your changes into their repository.

To issue a pull request:

1. First, you need a copy of the repository that contains the code you want to
   improve. To do so, you will **fork** it from its original location. You will
   also need to tell Git that this a copy of another project (a.k.a.,
   **upstream**)
2. You need to import the code onto your computer. To do so, you will **clone**
   your fork to your computer.
3. Now that the code is on your computer, you can edit and modify it. Once you
   are done you can **push** it to your repository.
4. Once the code is in your repository, you can issue a pull request so the
   original owner of the code (**upstream**) can review, comment, accept (or
   reject) your proposed modifications.
5. At some point, you will need to **pull** changes that occur upstream into
   your own repository if you want to keep contributing to the project.

How to do this using RStudio and GitHub?

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub for the project you would like to
   improve, and click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
   ![the GitHub fork button]({{ site.baseurl }}img/fork-button.png)
   This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. For
   instance, if I fork `https://github.com/r-bio/challenges-francois`, it will
   create a copy at `https://github.com/fmichonneau/challenges-francois`.
1. In RStudio, go to File > New Project, and choose "Version Control", select
   "Git", and type the repository URL found in _your_ copy of the repository
   listed in the right column on the GitHub website.
   ![the HTTPS address for the GitHub repository]({{ site.baseurl }}img/https-url.png)
   In our example this would be
   `https://github.com/fmichonneau/challenges-francois`, and choose an
   appropriate location on your hard-drive to store the project.
1. After a few seconds, the content of the repository should appear in the
   "Files" pane in RStudio.
1. At this point, we need to tell Git that this project has an upstream
   version. There is no way of doing this within RStudio, so you need to enter
   some commands in the shell. Go to Tools > Shell, and enter the address of the
   upstream repository (in our example
   `https://github.com/r-bio/challenges-francois`):

       `git remote add upstream https://github.com/r-bio/challenges-francois`

	Make sure that it worked by typing `git remote -v`, it should display 4
   lines, 2 that start with `origin` and the address of your fork, and 2 that
   start with `upstream` and the address of the upstream repository.  Note that
   here we used `upstream` to name the upstream repository but we could have
   given it another name. In this case, `upstream` is just easy to remember and
   accurate. Keep your shell window open.
1. We are now going to create a **branch** for our changes so they are
   self-contained. There is also no way to do this within RStudio so we are
   going to enter additional commands in the shell to create it:

		`git checkout -b proposed-fixes master`

	Here, `proposed-fixes` is an arbitrary name we give to our branch. Ideally,
    you want to choose a name that summarize what your proposed changes are
    about. After seeing the message `Switched to a new branch...`, you can close
    the shell window.
1. Open the script you would like to modify, and change the code as needed. Save
   your modifications.
1. When you are done, commit your changes:
   ![Commit in RStudio]({{ site.baseurl }}img/rstudio-commit.png)
   Click the staged checkbox for the files that are affected by the
   modifications you want to commit to your repository:
   ![Staged changes in RStudio]({{ site.baseurl }}img/rstudio-staged.png)
   Make sure that you are in the correct branch, (`proposed-fixes` appears next
   to the History button), and write a commit message: The first line should be short (< 50 characters),
   additional details can be given after skipping a line:
   ![Example commit message in RStudio]({{ site.baseurl }}img/rstudio-commit-message.png)
   Close the window, and go back to the shell. There, type:

     `git push origin proposed-fixes`

	This command sends your modification to your fork on GitHub.

1. Go to GitHub to view your fork, in our example that would be:
   `https://github.com/fmichonneau/challenges-francois`, and click on the green
   icon:
   ![The 'Compare' icon in GitHub]({{ site.baseurl }}img/github-branch.png)
1. Make sure that the correct branch is selected in the `compare` drop-down menu
   in the top right, and click on the green button: "Create pull request".
1. Leave a message with some explanation for your proposed changes and
   suggestions and click on the green button "Create Pull Request". This will
   send a notification to the owner of the repository who will review your
   request.

### What to do if you receive a pull request?

If you want to accept the pull request, you can click on the "Merge pull
request" button in your repository, and after adding an optional comment, click
again on the "Accept pull request" button.

After that, you need to import (pull) these changes into your local copy of the
repository. You should be able to do pull the changes by clicking on "Pull
branches" in the "Git" menu of your R project in RStudio.


## Exploring further

There are many resources on the web to learn about Git and GitHub:

- Git Tower provides a nice infographics that illustrates how the differents
  parts of the Git workflow fit
  together. [Git workflow](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/workflow-of-version-control)
- An excellent (but maybe too comprehensive for beginners) is the
[Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). This chapter is great to learn
how to use [GitHub](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) to
contribute to a project.
